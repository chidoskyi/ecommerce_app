# E-commerce API Flow Analysis Report

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the e-commerce application's API flow from checkout to payment processing, including identified issues and fixes applied.

## API Flow Architecture

### 1. Checkout Flow (`/api/checkout/`)

#### Main Checkout Route (`/api/checkout/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Primary checkout endpoint supporting multiple payment methods
- **Methods**: POST, GET, PUT
- **Payment Methods Supported**:
  - Opay (online payment gateway)
  - Cash on Delivery (COD)
  - Bank Transfer
  - Other payment methods (extensible)

#### Opay-Specific Checkout (`/api/checkout/opay/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Simplified Opay-only checkout flow
- **Method**: POST
- **Features**: Direct Opay payment initialization

### 2. Payment Processing (`/api/payments/`)

#### Opay Callback Handler (`/api/payments/opay/callback/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Handles payment verification and status updates from Opay
- **Methods**: POST (webhook), GET (manual verification)
- **Functionality**:
  - Verifies payment with Opay service
  - Updates order, checkout, and invoice statuses
  - Creates invoice payment records

### 3. Order Management (`/api/orders/`)

#### Orders Route (`/api/orders/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Order listing and creation
- **Methods**: GET, POST
- **Features**: Pagination, filtering, order creation

#### Individual Order Route (`/api/orders/[id]/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Single order operations
- **Methods**: GET, PUT, DELETE
- **Features**: Order details, status updates, cancellation

### 4. Invoice System (`/api/invoice/`)

#### Invoice Generation (`/api/invoice/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Invoice creation and retrieval
- **Methods**: GET, POST, PUT
- **Features**: PDF generation support, payment confirmation

#### Invoice Payments (`/api/invoice/payment/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Payment recording against invoices
- **Methods**: GET, POST, PUT
- **Features**: Payment tracking, bank transfer verification

## Database Schema Analysis

### Core Models
1. **User**: Customer information with Clerk authentication
2. **Product**: Product catalog with fixed/variable pricing
3. **Order**: Order management with comprehensive status tracking
4. **OrderItem**: Individual order line items
5. **Checkout**: Checkout session management
6. **CheckoutItem**: Checkout line items
7. **Invoice**: Invoice generation and management
8. **InvoiceItem**: Invoice line items
9. **InvoicePayment**: Payment tracking for invoices
10. **Payment**: Payment gateway integration
11. **Transaction**: Transaction logging
12. **Refund**: Refund management

### Key Relationships
- User → Orders (one-to-many)
- Order → OrderItems (one-to-many)
- Order → Invoice (one-to-one)
- Order → Checkout (one-to-one)
- Invoice → InvoicePayments (one-to-many)

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Reference Issues
**Problem**: Inconsistent database client references
- `db.product` instead of `prisma.product` in `/api/checkout/opay/route.ts`
- `db.order` instead of `prisma.order` in the same file

**Fix**: Updated all references to use the correct `prisma` client

### 2. Schema Mismatches
**Problem**: Code referencing non-existent fields
- `product.stock` field doesn't exist in schema
- `product.price` should be `product.fixedPrice`

**Fix**: 
- Removed stock validation (commented out for future implementation)
- Updated price references to use `fixedPrice`

### 3. Order Model Field Mismatches
**Problem**: Checkout/opay route using incorrect field names
- Using `subtotal`, `tax`, `shipping`, `total` instead of schema fields
- Missing required fields like `orderNumber`, `email`

**Fix**: Updated order creation to match schema:
- `subtotalPrice`, `totalTax`, `totalShipping`, `totalPrice`
- Added required `orderNumber` and `email` fields

### 4. Payment Callback Issues
**Problem**: Callback route expecting Payment model records that don't exist
- Looking for `payment.order` relationships
- Complex payment model structure not being used

**Fix**: Simplified callback to work directly with orders:
- Find orders by `paymentId` or `transactionId`
- Update order status directly
- Create invoice payment records as needed

### 5. API Route Structure
**Problem**: Mixed API patterns (Pages API vs App Router)
- Old orders route using Pages API pattern
- Inconsistent middleware usage

**Fix**: Created new App Router compatible routes:
- `/api/orders/route.ts` (GET, POST)
- `/api/orders/[id]/route.ts` (GET, PUT, DELETE)

## Payment Flow Verification

### Opay Integration
1. **Initialization**: `opayService.initializePayment()`
2. **Verification**: `opayService.verifyPayment()`
3. **Callback Processing**: Automatic status updates
4. **Manual Verification**: GET endpoint for status checks

### Configuration
- Merchant ID: `256625072718392`
- Base URL: `https://api.opaycheckout.com`
- Callback URL: Configured for webhook handling
- Environment: Properly configured in `.env`

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Clerk-based authentication for all routes
- User-specific data access controls
- Admin role checks for sensitive operations

### Data Validation
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Product existence verification
- Address ownership validation
- Payment amount verification

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test each API endpoint individually
- Mock external services (Opay)
- Validate database operations

### 2. Integration Tests
- End-to-end checkout flow
- Payment callback handling
- Order status transitions

### 3. Load Testing
- Concurrent checkout operations
- Payment processing under load
- Database performance

## API Endpoints Summary
